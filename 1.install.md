# Install instruction from scratch for a Raspberry PI



## Server dependencies and resource needed to run the app
Instructions for setting up an RPI to run the code in this repo. I assume you are using Raspbian OS. When creating these instructions I was able to install and configure on a Raspberry PI Zero with no issues. It won't collect as many data points as the PI 4 but did fine. That said I'd imagine what you can install it on any PI version from 1 through 4.



## Start with a OS
Download and install [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) from the Raspberry PI site. Follow the steps to get it booted up and on your network. 

I have not been able to get OpenCV to work in the lite version with Python `virtualenvwrapper`, so you'll want the **full version** with desktop. You can configure with `raspi-config` to boot only into the shell to save resources.  



### OPTION: RSA key for SSH
If you have an RSA key for SSH follow these steps to make it easier to login to your Server. Skip this step if you have no idea what a RSA key is.
```
HOST_IP=server_ip_address
ssh-copy-id pi@${HOST_IP}
```


## Configure your PI
1. Make sure your camera is connected to your RPI. Of course not while the device is on.
![Install Camera](html/assets/install-rpi-cam.jpg?raw=true "Install Camera")
2. Enable the camera by running
```
sudo raspi-config
```
Then navigate through the menus. On my version it was
    a. Interface Options
    b. Camera
    c. <yes>
    d. <OK>
    e. <Finish> and exit
    f. Reboot
![Enable RPI Cam](html/assets/install_enable_picam.png?raw=true "Enable RPI Cam")


3. Run through by using your arrow & tab keys, the configurations to setup timezones, passwords, and other customizations.
5. Reboot after clicking the `<finish>` button at the bottom. 
4. After reboot test the camera by taking a picture by running this command. The Image will save as `testshot.jpg`, in the directory you run the command.
```
raspistill -o testshot.jpg
```
- To view the image, open the current working directory you ran the command. In the directory click the image 
```
    pcmanfm .
```
5. Do the same thing to test video, but with this command. Open and play the video to ensure all is working. If not stop here and trouble shoot with Google, I'll wait here.
```
    raspivid -w 1280 -h 720 -fps 30 -o testvideo.h264 -t 5000
```
- To view the video, open the current working directory you ran the command. In the directory click the video 
```
    pcmanfm .
```


## If you have less than 2gb of RAM enable swap.
Even with a PI zero with 512MB of RAM, usage was fine. If you have low RAM, swap will ensure your app or OS won't crash, but will slow things down. 
```
sudo sed -ri 's/^CONF_SWAPSIZE\=.*/CONF_SWAPSIZE\=2048/g' /etc/dphys-swapfile
sudo service dphys-swapfile restart
```


## Update & Upgrade your system
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# full upgrade is optional but while we're here why now.
sudo apt -y full-upgrade

sudo reboot
```


#### OPTION: install SMB & VIM
Install your editor of choice, mine is `vim`. And if you want to be able to access your RPI files over the network `SAMBA`. Not going to give any details here. You can skip this step if this stuff is sounding like non sense.
```
apt -y install samba vim
```
Edit `/etc/samba/smb.conf` with sudo, I use `vi` but if you don't know it, use `nano`, `sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf`. Fine the `[home]` config heading delete everything and replace with the below. This allows you to access your PI `home` folder from any computer on your network.
```
[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = no
   read only = no
   create mask = 0775
   directory mask = 0750
   valid users = %S
```
Set a password for user `pi` to access the home drive we created above, then restart the Samba service
```
smbpasswd -a pi
systemctl reload smbd.service
```
Get the IP of your PI server with 
```
ip addr show
```
TO access your home drive:
1. MAC `CMD` + `k` key, then type `smb://pi@192.168.x.x` in the text field at the top, replace **192.168.x.x*** with the ip of your server
2. PC open the file explorer or `WIN` + `e` key, then type `\\pi@192.168.x.x\pi` in the text field at the top, replace **192.168.x.x*** with the ip of your server


From here Google mounding SMB drive to access the drive from your computer, if you have issues.



## Install Packages
The full version of Raspbian (the desktop version) will most have python3  with pip installed but does not hurt to run the below to ensure, it's updated. 
```
sudo apt-get -y install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-apt git cmake python-opencv libatlas-base-dev python3-pip
```
**note** we install `python-opencv` here to ensure all dependencies for it are installed, but we won't use this build version.


### Python virtualenvwrapper 
In case you want other Python apps that run different versions of packages we use here, we want to install a `virtualenvwrapper` for Python. 


a. Install the virtualenvwrapper
```
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
```

b. Ensure the virtualenvwrapper dependencies loads on login. **Run only once**, as running more than once will cause it to load multiple times.
```
cat <<EOT >> ~/.bashrc

# virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
EOT
```

c. load the virtualenvwrapper dependencies, in our current session. Optionally you can log out then back it, as this will run each time you login.
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

d. create a virtualenvwrapper named `py3cv4`. As soon as you run the below you should see `(py3cv4)` at the beginning your cursor in the shell.
```
mkvirtualenv py3cv4 -p python3
```
![Python2 OpenCV4](html/assets/install-py3cv4.png?raw=true "Python2 OpenCV4")

e. Every time you open a new shell or login you will want to run the below command to change to this virtualenvwrapper. This is especially true if you run the `*.py` files manually. If you use the shell scripts (`*.sh` in the scripts directory) in this repo, they will automatically assume `py3cv4` is your virtualenvwrapper.
```
workon py3cv4
```

d. Read more on [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)



## Now we are ready to checkout the code and get going
1. Checkout this code into a directory called repos in your home directory
```
cd ~ && mkdir repos && cd repos
git clone https://github.com/RHM-rchu/pi-speed-tracker
```
2. Copy the config templates files so you can adjust later one, in the next part of these instruction in [setup](2.setup.md)
```
cd pi-speed-tracker
cp _configs_sample.py _configs.py 
cp _configs_coords.py _configs_coords_sample.py
```

## Python Package
Pick **a)** or **b)** to install the python package, doing both hurts nothing but time. Depending on the processor and RAM, this can take upwards of an hour or so, so check in every so often on this to make sure it does not error out. 
#### a) The simple way
```
pip install -r pip.requirements.txt
```
#### b) The non simple way, but still easy
```
pip  wheel picamera setuptools mako opencv-python numpy
```

### Now we are ready to jump into the [setup](2.setup.md) page
