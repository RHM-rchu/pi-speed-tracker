# Install instruction from scratch for a Raspberry PI

## Server dependencies and resource needed to run the app
Instructions for setting up an RPI to run the code in this repo. I assume you are using Raspbian OS.


### Start with a OS
Download and install [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) from the Raspberry PI site. Follow the steps to get it booted up and on your network.


### OPTION: RSA key for SSH
If you have an RSA key for SSH follow these steps to make it easier to login to your Server. Skip this step if you have no idea what a RSA key is.
```
HOST_IP=server_ip_address
ssh-copy-id pi@${HOST_IP}
```


### Configure your PI
1. Make sure your camera is connected to your RPI. Of course not while the device is on.
![Install Camera](html/assets/install-rpi-cam.jpg?raw=true "Install Camera")
2. Enable the camera by running
```
sudo raspi-config
```
Then navigate through the menus. On my version it was
    a. Interface Options
    b. Camera
    c. <yes>
    d. <OK>
    e. <Finish> and exit
    f. Reboot
![Enable RPI Cam](html/assets/sample_enable_picam.png?raw=true "Enable RPI Cam")
3. Run through by using your arrow & tab keys, the configurations to setup timezones, passwords, and other customizations.
5. Reboot after clicking the `<finish>` button at the bottom. 
4. After reboot test the camera by taking a picture by running this command. The Image will save as `testshot.jpg`, in the directory you run the command.
```
raspistill -o testshot.jpg
```
    a. To view the image, you can open the current directory by running 
```
    pcmanfm .
```
5. Do the same thing to test video, but with this command. Open and play the video to ensure all is working. If not stop here and trouble shoot with Google, I'll wait here.
```
    raspivid -w 1280 -h 720 -fps 30 -o testvideo.h264 -t 5000
```


### If you have less than 2gb of RAM enable swap.
```
sudo sed -ri 's/^CONF_SWAPSIZE\=.*/CONF_SWAPSIZE\=2048/g' /etc/dphys-swapfile
sudo service dphys-swapfile restart
```


### Update & Upgrade your system
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade 
sudo apt -y full-upgrade

sudo reboot
```


### OPTION: install SMB & VIM
Install your editor of choice, mine is `vim`. And if you want to be able to access your RPI files over the network `SAMBA`. Not going to give any details here. You can skip this step if this stuff is sounding like non sense.
```
apt -y install samba vim
smbpasswd -a pi
systemctl reload smbd.service
```


### Install Python3
If you installed the full version of Raspbian (the desktop version), you most likely have python3 installed but does not hurt to run the below to ensure, it's updated.
```
sudo apt-get -y install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-apt git cmake python-opencv
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
sudo python3 get-pip.py
```


### Python virtualenvwrapper 
In case you want other Python apps that run different versions of packages we use here, we want to install a virtualenvwrapper for Python. 
    a. Install the virtualenvwrapper
```
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
```
    b. Ensure the virtualenvwrapper dependencies loads on login. **Run only once**, as running more than once will cause it to load multiple times.
```
cat <<EOT >> ~/.bashrc

# virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
EOT
```
    c. load the virtualenvwrapper dependencies, in our current session. Optionally you can log out then back it, as this will run each time you login.
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
    d. create a virtualenvwrapper named `py3cv4`. As soon as you run the below you should see `(py3cv4)` at the beginning your cursor in the shell.
```
mkvirtualenv py3cv4 -p python3
```
![Python2 OpenCV4](html/assets/install-py3cv4.png?raw=true "Python2 OpenCV4")
    e. Every time you open a new shell or login you will want to run the below command to change to this virtualenvwrapper. This is especially true if you run the `*.py` files manually. If you use the shell scripts (`*.sh` in the scripts directory) in this repo, they will automatically assume `py3cv4` is your virtualenvwrapper.
```
workon py3cv4
```
    d. Read more on [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)



### No we are ready to checkout the code and get going
1. Checkout this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/RHM-rchu/pi-speed-tracker
```
2. Copy the config templates files so you can adjust later one, in the next part of these instruction in [setup](2.setup.md)
```
cd pi-speed-tracker
cp _configs_sample.py _configs.py 
cp _configs_coords.py _configs_coords_sample.py
```
3. Create a directory for logs, and ensure the run as your has access to the logs directory. The run as user will be your account, in the shell using the variable `${USER}` resolves to your account, in this case user `pi`. 

```
sudo mkdir /var/log/speed && sudo chown -R ${USER}: /var/log/speed
```

### Python Package
Pick **a)** or **b)** to install the python package, doing both hurts nothing but time. Depending on the processor and RAM, this can take upwards of an hour or so, so check in every so often on this to make sure it does not error out. 
#### a) The simple way
```
pip install -r pip.requirements.txt
```
#### b) The non simple way, but still easy
```
pip setuptools wheel
pip install picamera
pip install opencv-python numpy
#opencv-contrib-python==4.1.0.25
pip install mako
```

### Now we are ready to jump into the [setup](2.setup.md) page
