## Calibration

Go to your Raspberry PI desktop environment and open a terminal. Run the calibrator.py app. This will pop a video player where you can draw a green triangle in the video player, select the region you want to monitor. This automatically set the coordinate in a file called `_configs_coords.py`. It's advised that you only use this program to set the Region Of Interest (ROI), which is the road area you want to monitor.
```
python calibrator.py
```
Draw the box around the road area to monitor. Once you are satisfied with the selection press, [ECS] key. This will save and/or create `_configs_coords.py` with the coordinates you selected for the app to monitor. No further edits are needed. This also saves an still image in `media/images/calibrator.jpg` with what you selected for reference (you will need to reference for the next step). If you move or even bump the camera you will need to repeat this step to recalibrate.

![Calibrator Sample](html/assets/sample_calibrator.png?raw=true "Calibrator Sample") 


Open `media/images/calibrator.jpg` and from the camera lens to the bottom left and right corner of the ROI box in calibrator.jpg measure the distance in feet. Yes! you do have to go outside to get measurements, can't do this step with your computer. 

Add the measurements into `_configs.py` as feed in `L2R_DISTANCE` (left corner) and `R2L_DISTANCE` (right corner)
```
# define some constants
L2R_DISTANCE = 120                      #<---- enter your distance-to-road value for cars going left to right here
R2L_DISTANCE = 120                      #<---- enter your distance-to-road value for cars going left to right here
...
```
While you're here edit and adjust the rest of the configs, they should be fairly obvious, if not read the description.


## Running the webserver
This starts the webserver for real time graphs and data. If left to the default open the page in a browser at http://[server_ip_or_localhost]:8080 
```
./scripts/service-manager.sh -a web -x start
```

## Auto Start & Stop
Start webserver on boot, in `crontab` add the below line, change the path to the full repo path of `service-manager.sh`
    - run `crontab -e`, and in your editor of choice
```
@reboot ${HOME}/repos/pi-speed-tracker/scripts/service-manager.sh -a web -x start >/dev/null 2>&1
```
    - optional to auto start and top the speed `speed-tracker.py` script to monitor traffic (at night), start and stop. run `crontab -e`, and in your editor of choice
```
0 7 * * * ${HOME}/repos/pi-speed-tracker/scripts/service-manager.sh -a speed -x start >/dev/null 2>&1
0 17 * * * ${HOME}/repos/pi-speed-tracker/scripts/service-manager.sh -a speed -x stop >/dev/null 2>&1
```

in this case we start at 7am and stop at 5pm every day. Familiarize with crontab if you want to adjust. The change paths to your paths

The above uses the shell script manager, you can use this script to do many things run `service-manager.sh -h` to see options
```
scripts/
├── load.py.virtualenv.sh       <--- this file can be ignored
└── service-manager.sh          <--- start/stop/status script for apps to see options run: service-manager.sh -h 
```
