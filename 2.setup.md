![Menu](html/assets/setup_hamburger_menu.png?raw=true "Menu")

2. On the Top of the page click **Retake snapshot**. This fires up the webcam and takes a single frame of what your Camera sees. It's here that we make sure the camera is pointed in the correct place and is in focus. Each time you adjust you'll need to click the "Retake snapshot" link to view your changes. 

3. Once you Camera is pointed at the correct region and in focus, you can select the Point Of Interest (POI). Draw a rectangle on the road from top right to bottom left. Leave room on the left and right side so when cars go out of bounds of the POI, they don't get cropped. The app will automatically shift to the left and right when capturing an image to ensure cars aren't cropped. Click the Save button, when you are satisfied with the area you've drawn.
